# cnn-ann-mnist-classifier
A deep learning project for handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset. The model combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for feature extraction and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for classification. Implemented with TensorFlow/Keras, including visualization of results and evaluation with confusion matrices.
